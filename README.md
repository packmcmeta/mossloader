# mossloader
so it loads pluginbs!


the src is so big u need to view it with gdrive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xSW-qjFPTtWd1jC6UhIZCAlUwhJzNyTp?usp=drive_link


so grab mosshosts from gdrive and extract it then put it in the documents folder



credit to spigotmc for the plugin engine



DONT USE RN! IN HEAVY DEV!
